# Text Database Manager 

Using Python, I decided to make a fun little project: a database management tool like SQL.

## Features

So far, this is what it can do:
- Create tables
- Delete tables
- Add rows
- Automatically keep track of creation and update time

## Installation

This is pretty lightweight so you just have to have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

```Work in progress...```


## Notes
This is not intended to be a full-fledged database management system. Hope you think it's cool anyways.

Happy coding!
